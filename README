Ok, nothing to see here. no really - nothing at all.

This is simply an app for to track expenses and let us know when we've gone over budget. by time I get it done, we will of course be broke.

It doesn't particularly follow sound accounting practice, and will never be (i hope) yet another double entry accounting system. Its hoped its just simple obvious to use to reduce barriers to actually using it, using simple self evident ideas. Of course, it may be that along the way I realise why this generally isn't done.

Its also  intended as an exercise in observeration in the way I engage in the various decision making processes involved along the way to producing something and a practice of choosing pragmatic over 'correct', an attempt to purge the software fundamentalst out of me.

This readme file will more or less contain my thoughts of the process, which is prob a little fool hardy give this is in 'the open', but meh.

Concerns... 
* ok this outgoing / incomings thing really is feeling a bit cumbersome. sure it was the _simplest_ possible thing that could work at the  time, but this has got silly... its bit too simplistic and the two table thing is equally silly.
