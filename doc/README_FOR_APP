Purpose of this was to throw together an app in an afternoon that would tomoroow let my wife and I start to:
* Record money spent
* Where the money was sourced from
* What the money went towards
* Provide feed back as we approached our preconfigured amount for that
* Is extensible so that i can start to do from my phone / laptop etc etc 
* As well as recording money that moves from a source, money moving into and between the sources wants to be acknowledged

Given those as few simple use case statements.. here are some slightly less so
* it may be necessary to record with varying degrees of specificity what 'money toward something' means. In otherwords theres a bit of a hierachy of categorisations.
